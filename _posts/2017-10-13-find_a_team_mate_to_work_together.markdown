In real world a lot of companies have off shore offices, people work in different places and different time zones but on the same project. There are advantages to do so but for devs who work on the project and managers who manage the team, it is hard. 

I worked on project with remote developers in team but I worked as a Test Engineer. I don't really have experience in working on the same development project with another person. Tic Tac Toe - AI offers the opportunity to find a team mate. It takes me a while to make decision.

First I would like to do Solo, because I do all the labs in learn.co by myself and if met a problem I will ask in AAQ or share screen with a tech coach. Everything works well so far. In this way I know I can wrok out the lab. But I also asked tech coach and in communitiy about how people colaborate on the lab in different locations. Most of the feedbacs are positive. Make efforts to find another person who is at the same progress as myself in program. Sent out friend request and ask them if they are interested in colaborate. Also as a team we will work on Github keep our code beautifully and working. Every effort made to find a team mate seems pretty practical in real life. So I decided to take the challenge. The worst is if it takes too long to finish the lab I can switch back to solo. 

Luckily after I sent out my friend request, Booligan accepted the invitation and asked me if I was interested to work on Tic Tac Toe together. Actually at that time, he already made some progress(a lot) by himself. We made sure we could figure out some time to work side by side remotely. Then I cloned his code in Github, read the code and started working on the left methods. During coding, we shared our code, errors, problems that we met and exchanged suggestions. The most important thing working as a team is encouragement and trust. It took us whole night to pass all the test suites in Tic Tac Toe-AI. I think it is pretty awesome. And I knew a new friend. 

I am glad that I chose to work as a team in this lab. Everything is worthy to try.
