I planned to work on Rails jQuery front end protofolio project for 2 weeks originally. I work on BootCamp parttime. 
During the last part of Rails and Javascript, I had to move. It is not far away but still have to prepare and plan 
for packing, U-haul rental and scheduleing time with friends for help. A lot of things would happen during my project time and I have talked with other students, then I gave myself two weeks.

This morning Apr 7th after I took 1:1 for a review I completed all the requirements for the project. It took me a week. I am very happy and proud of myself. Of course I get a lot of help from project prep study groups, instructors and other students. I appreciate that.

I recall my first project CLI project, I felt it was the most difficult one. It shouldn't be compared to what I am creating now. But why?

In the first month or two, my goal was every week kept my lessons around 25 +. And I was trying very hard to keep that record. So I didn't think deeply why but I focused on how. When the time came to do the big projects, every lesson contributes, so studying fast doesn't give me deep understanding of the knowledge. I had to go back and go over again and search information online for examples. 

Rails and jQuery, some lessons in Building APIs session I went over several times before I started my project. I totally understand the purpose of these lessons and how they would play a part in the project. I also started early to attend the project prep study group. I cleared my doubts early and from others' questions and issues I learnt as well. The confidence building up is very important. I am glad that I switched my studying strategy and I've seen it works.
