I would like to share my story of first portfolio project because I didn't have many clues when I started.

When I first saw the instruction of CLI portfolio project, I didn't know where to start and it seems like a tons of things included in this project. I felt scared and wasn't sure if I can figure it out. I think I am not the only one feels like this way.

Before I started to code, I attended one CLI project open hour. Corinna walked through the best 50 restaurants project's code and talked about what topics other students have chosen. It was quite helpful. It gave me some clue of what this project finally would complete. 

Next I try to find out some interesting topics that I would like to apply CLI project. It needs something with ranking list. I select top universities ranking in US. Yea, I like school. After figure out the content, the next thing is to find a suitable website which has all the information you need. I think it is easier to find a website use list to list all the rankings by a particular id or class. 

Usually I will learn by sequence in the curriculum but for final project, learn.co provides a lot of videos to walk through different code models and errors students have made. Before I started I watched all the videos and chose one to use as a code along example. Make sure to change the content of scraper for my sepcific website and make Cli user friendly. 

Reserve an appointment with special instructor on this project. Before submitting the project, discuss with instructors about your thoughts in this project. Show your code and play around with it. Get some suggestions and refactor the code. 

Make things work and understand how each part of the code colaborates are important for this lab. As I move forward and I've seen the project works little by little, I've built up more confidence so you can do it too.
