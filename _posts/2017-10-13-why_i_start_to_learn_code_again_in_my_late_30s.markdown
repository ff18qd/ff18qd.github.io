I’m almost 40 years old now and I don’t know how to code, despite the best efforts to learn in my 20s. Back in China one of my professors told us early in my college career that girls were not suitable for coding – “You girls better learn something else,” he said. He disliked answering our questions and made me feel as though my questions were foolish. Over time, I started to believe that I couldn’t solve problems because of my gender. 

In China people tend to live their lives in stereotypes, follow the majority and are afraid of changes. Because other people will judge and criticize. I used to be one of them. But after one trip to the States, I found that here I was encouraged to improve and change myself. After living in the US for 4 years, I am still convinced that working hard to realize individual dreams is appreciated and will pay off.

I decided to focus again on learning to code to elevate my skills in troubleshooting as a Quality Assruance Engineer. When I encounter an issue, I can describe the phenomenon and problem reproduce steps. But if I understand coding and web development, I can figure out which part of the code might cause the issue and provide suggestions for solutions. If I code and develop, I can shift my vision and thoughts into development and design, rather than viewing things/features at the aggregate-level in a system. In my future work, I want to approach with a customer-centric lens. Development is not only about making things work –it is about ensuring each part coordinates with others and is easy to upgrade for further functions.

I made a plan for myself and tried to study 2 hours before or after work every day last year. I taught myself Java and Selenium Web Driver. I took online courses to learn JavaScript and Python. I used what I learned to find a new job as an automation Quality Assurance Engineer. 

It was not easy, I met a lot of failures but I know that if I didn’t try nothing could happen. Self-studying is difficult because the time spend just gathering background information and try different resources to figure out which language is good which course suits me.

A bootcamp could be a better choice for me. I started Flatiron school’s free prep camp initially based on its high reviews and because of an introductory phone call with an advisor before I even started the course. I’m also impressed by how Flatiron helps and cares about students – I had an issue that mocha was unable to find my defined function. A technical coach jumped in immediately, I shared my screen with her at 10:30 pm, and the problem was solved after troubleshooting for 15 minutes. I feel supported and confident that Flatiron will help my learning and growth.

20 years after my college professor told me that females shouldn’t code, I have met many different people and have heard many stories from successful female software developers. I believe I am on my way.
